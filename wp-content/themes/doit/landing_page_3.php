						<p>The technology of HIT, which makes it possible to conduct online video interview, is simply irreplaceable in finding the employee for an out-of-office work. That is why a competent psychologist is able to get maximum of useful information during the live communication which a questionnaire or testing is simply unable to give. In fact, while choosing future employee, gestures, manner of speach, character, a way to put  yourself and general appearence can tell a lot about a person . The technology of HIT gives you exactly this priceless possibility of live communication.

  <li>
Online interview saves time and resources for both employer and potential employee.
  </li>
  <li>Potential employee, while having an interview in a home environment, feels calmer, more confident and less exposed to stress.
</li>
  <li>An interviewer can not cause stressful situation for the candidate because there is no direct communication. Although it is certainly necessary to set some non-standard questions.</li>

						<p>Two types of interview are foreseen in the system - synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous means having an interview in a live video chat (just like in  Skype), where one or a few reviewers communicate with applicants in real time. Asynchronous - applicant answers some questions concerning the certain vacancy on camera.
